# Astronomy and Interpretability: Random Forests Learn the Inverse Square Law

Code written by Naveen Durvasula, Haydn Gwyn, Oskar Hurst, and Sarthak Arora.

The notebook *Inverse Square Law.ipynb* contains all code needed to reproduce the results in our paper. In order to run our code, the following dependencies are needed
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- astropy
- shap
- JPL Solar System Ephemeris extension for astropy

By modifying the *planets* list defined in the first block of code, along with the corresponding dictionary *days*, data for different planets will automatically be pulled from the JPL Solar System Ephemeris and the remainder of the code will provide a similar analysis for these new planets.
